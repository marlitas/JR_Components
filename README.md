The code snippets held within each collection are intented to be used as a foundation for a wide range of features, and create a universal starting point for all JR developers and students. Most code snippets require little customization to work 'out of the box'. 

### How to Use
Components have been sorted into collections dependent on their most relatable tag. Clicking on a specific collection will take you to the repository readme for that collection where you can find more information about the components held within, as well as examples of each component's final product.
