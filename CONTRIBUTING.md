<h1 align='center'> Contributing to the Library </h1>

<h4 align='center'> So you're thinking about contributing? Welcome! </h5>

We're so excited that you're here and reading through this carefully prepared document. It helps us (and you) make sure that our component library stays accurate, diverse, and bug-free! 

The contribution guidelines here help to ensure respect between the developers managing this library and those contributing. In the end this allows for a smoother process as the managing developers address your issues, assess changes, and help you finalize your pull requests. 

We thank you in advance for reading through and following these guidelines!

### Types of Contributions

The Justice Reskill Component Library is a digital space where our community, whether student or employee, can come together and bond through code. The library is only as robust as we make it, so we depend on everyone to keep this library stocked and up-to-date. That's where you come in! There are many ways to contribute, from improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code to submit your very own component to the library.

### Please Don't

Please don't submit a fully functional application here. Submitted components should be easy to read through and throw into an existing code base. A majority of components will only require one file to implement, so think small. A component should pass testing standards, but may not be production ready. The library is here to provide a platform for developers who want to take your code into production for their specific use case, therefore it needs to be easy to customize and understand.

We also request that you not submit support questions as an issue. For any support needs, visit the appropriate Slack channel in the Justice Reskill workspace.

# Ground Rules
### Culture
We aim to keep a welcoming and open environment for all those who want to be part of the Justice Reskill Component Library. The following lists out just some of the ways we can do that through our interactions. This is by no means a comprehensive list, and we encourage everyone to listen and adapt. 

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of differeing viewpoints and opinions
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the Justice Reskill community
- Show empathy towards others.

### Tech Responsibilites
- To the best of your ability ensure [cross-browser compatibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Introduction) for all components submitted. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, etc..
- Ensure that code meets all requirements on this checklist: https://gist.github.com/audreyr/4feef90445b9680475f2
- Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
- Don't add any collections to the library unless absolutely necessary. If you would like to add a collection please submit an issue outlining the reason and need.
- Keep pull requests as small as possible. Preferably one component per pull request.
- Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

# Your First Contribution
The Component Library is a great place to try out your first contribution. There are loads of ways to add to the library, and the following info will help you navigate those options.

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:
### Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
   Beginner issues can involve fixing a bug in a component, creating a small component, or adding in documentation. If you get stuck anywhere, comment on the issues and someone should hopefully be able to help out. 
   
### Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues. 
   Help wanted issues can be a bit more complex than beginner issues, but they allow you to pair with the other developer who is working on this issue. Don't worry you won't be taking the lead here, but these issues can be a good transition point to work on something bigger by yourself. 

If you're still concerned about contributing, here are a couple of resources to help:

# Getting started

* Legal info? Maybe something about how this is a Library for Justice Reskill community ONLY? You have to be a student or an employee? 

### Testing Requirements
Code must pass some sort of testing. Testing will vary from component to component... maybe using some sort of test coverage package and showing passing tests along with that coverage package.

### Dev Environment
Make sure your dev environment matches the one of the collection you want to add to. Check that collections file for further instuctions. 

# How to report a bug
### Security Vulnerabilities
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email XXXX instead.

### Filing a Bug Report

When starting a bug issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
1. What dev environment (and the versions) are you using?
2. What web browser are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?


# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
### If you have a particular roadmap, goals, or philosophy for development, share it here.
This information will give contributors context before they make suggestions that may not align with the project’s needs.

### Suggesting a Collection
If there is back-and-forth or signoff required, say so. Ask them to scope the feature, thinking through why it’s needed and how it might work.

# Code review process
### Explain how a contribution gets accepted after it’s been submitted.
Who reviews it? Who needs to sign off before it’s accepted? When should a contributor expect to hear from you? How can contributors get commit access, if at all?

# Community
Justice Reskill Slack Workspace. Specific channel for the component library?

# Conventions
### Explain if you use any labeling conventions for issues.
