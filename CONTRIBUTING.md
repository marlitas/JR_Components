# Overview :earth_africa:

### :thumbsup: Types of Contributions 

The Justice Reskill Component Library is a digital space where our community, whether student or employee, can come together and bond through code. The library is only as robust as we make it, so we depend on everyone to keep this library stocked and up-to-date. That's where you come in! There are many ways to contribute, from improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code to submit your very own component to the library.

### :pray: Please Don't 

Please don't submit a fully functional application here. Submitted components should be easy to read through and throw into an existing code base. A majority of components will only require one file to implement, so think small. A component should pass testing standards, but may not be production ready. The library is here to provide a platform for developers who want to take your code into production for their specific use case, therefore it needs to be easy to customize and understand.

We also request that you not submit support questions as an issue. For any support needs, visit the appropriate Slack channel in the Justice Reskill workspace.

# Ground Rules :guardsman:

### Culture 
We aim to keep a welcoming and open environment for all those who want to be part of the Justice Reskill Component Library. The following lists out just some of the ways we can do that through our interactions. This is by no means a comprehensive list, and we encourage everyone to listen and adapt. 

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of differeing viewpoints and opinions
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the Justice Reskill community
- Show empathy towards others.

### Tech Responsibilites 
- To the best of your ability ensure [cross-browser compatibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Introduction) for all components submitted. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, etc..
- Ensure code has proper formatting, syntax, security standards, and efficiency.
- Create issues for any changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
- Don't add any collections to the library unless absolutely necessary.
- Keep pull requests as small as possible. Preferably one component per pull request.
- Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

# Your First Contribution :raising_hand:

The Component Library is a great place to try out your first contribution. There are loads of ways to add to the library, and the following info will help you navigate those options.

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:
### :round_pushpin: [Beginner issues](https://github.com/Justice-Reskill/JR-Component-Library/labels/good%20first%20issue) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
   Beginner issues can involve fixing a bug in a component, creating a small component, or adding in documentation. If you get stuck anywhere, comment on the issues and someone should hopefully be able to help out. 
   
### :handshake: [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/Justice-Reskill/JR-Component-Library/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues. 
   Help wanted issues can be a bit more complex than beginner issues, but they allow you to pair with the other developer who is working on this issue. Don't worry you won't be taking the lead here, but these issues can be a good transition point to work on something bigger by yourself. 

If you're still concerned about contributing, here are a couple of resources to help:
- [Making a pull request](http://makeapullrequest.com/)
- [Free Code Camp Github Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk)
- [Version Control & Git Basics](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control)

# Getting started :sunny:

Currently this library is for Justice Reskill employees and students ONLY. In order to gain access to this repository ask your management or instructor. Pull Requests and Issues from outside persons will be closed.

### Contribution Process
The contribution process may look different for everyone dependent on the complexity of the issue assigned. No matter what the recommended steps are:

1. **[Pick/Create issue](https://github.com/Justice-Reskill/JR-Component-Library/issues) and assign yourself**
   - If you are creating an issue, be sure to answer the following questions: 
     - Which collection is this associated with?
     - What problem will this solve?
     - What is the recommended solution?
     - What resources can you provide to add clarity?
     
2. **Fork and Clone the repository**

   *[Checkout this resource for cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)*
   
3. **Create a new branch**

   *[Checkout this resource for creating and managing branches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2IbNHi4uCI)*
   
4. **Comment or push code once a month**
   - If no updates have been posted to the issue through code or comments we will remove you off the issue to open it up for others.
   - Pushing code up and asking for feedback before you submit a pull request is always an option. 
   - If at any point you would like help on your issue, add the "help wanted".

   *[Checkout this resource on connecting commits to an issue](https://gitdailies.com/articles/link-github-commit-to-issue/)*
   
5. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Before you create a pull request make sure you're passing the testing and documentation requirements outlined below!
   - Pull Request templates should load in automatically, but in case it doesn't copy and paste the template from [here]().
   - Fill out the entire pull request and make sure you can check off all the boxes.
   
   *[Checkout to-do before opening a Pull Request](https://medium.com/swlh/do-these-things-before-opening-that-pr-5ed9934e83df)*
   *[Checkout this resource on creating a Pull Request](https://www.better.dev/create-your-first-github-pull-request)*
   
6. **Respond to feedback**
   - Once your pull request is out in the wild, one of our managing developers will respond with any feedback or changes that need to be applied in order to merge your pull request into main. 
   - The feedback process may take a few rounds to get it right. Don't worry. We all go through that process, and the feedback helps us grow as developers as well as ensure code quality in the library.
   
   *[Checkout this resource about merging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX-Kct0PfFc)*
   
7. **Celebrate when merged!**

### Documentation Requirements

The addition of any new component requires adequate documentation. The bare minimum documentation includes:
 - Adding component name and link to collection.md
 - Adding image, gif, or short video next to component name in collection.md
 - Stating development environment if different than what is defined in collection.md
 - Providing comments for code legibility in component code files
 - Providing comments for dependencies within code

The more documentation you provide, the easier it will be for others to use your component. When writing documentation think about legibility, grammar, and accessibility. Terminology that may be specific to a particular language may not be helpful to another developer learning that language. Allow documentation to be an opportunity to break down your code, and understand it even further. How would you describe what you did to someone with little/to no prior experience?

### Testing Requirements 
Any component must pass all tests with a coverage rate >= 95%. Below are common test coverage packages for different languages and frameworks. Pull requests must include a screenshot of coverage and test results in order to receive feedback.

| Language | Coverage Tool | Documentation |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Javascript / React | Jest | [Docs](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/) |
| Javascript / Express | Istanbul | [Docs](https://istanbul.js.org/) |
| Python | Coverage.py | [Docs](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/6.2/) |
| Ruby | SimpleCov | [Docs](https://github.com/simplecov-ruby/simplecov) |

Further Testing Resources:

- [Code Coverage with Jest](https://medium.com/@blturner3527/code-coverage-and-testing-with-jest-9641b5d0e0bc)

### Development Environment 
Make sure your development environment matches that of the collection you want to add to. Check that collection's markdown file for further instuctions. 

Only change the development environment of a component if absolutely necessary. Explain the need for this change, and how to set up the environment in your documentation.

# Report a Bug :bug:

### Security Vulnerabilities 
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email XXXX instead.

### Filing a Bug Report 

When starting a bug issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
1. What dev environment (and the versions) are you using?
2. What web browser are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

# Suggesting an Enhancement :mega:

### Component Library Roadmap and Goals 
This information will give contributors context before they make suggestions that may not align with the project’s needs.

### Suggesting a Collection 
If there is back-and-forth or signoff required, say so. Ask them to scope the feature, thinking through why it’s needed and how it might work.

<a name="code-review-process"></a>
# Code review process :mag_right:

### :hourglass_flowing_sand: Timeline 
There is no set timeline for how long a review process may take. Since managing developers are also working on Justice Reskill client projects, it may take some time to receive feedback on your pull request. This is why we recommend you make each pull request as small and readable as possible. Managing developers will try their hardest to respond to your pull request with feedback or a timeline update within two weeks. 

If it has been over a month and you have not heard from a managing developer on your pull request, go ahead and tag them in a comment to check-in.

### :eyes: Review Team 
Justice Reskill Developers are assigned to manage the component library as needed. The managing developers may change over time, but all work for Justice Reskill in some capacity. Access to merge or push code to the main branch is only given to managing developers, and upper level developers at Justice Reskill. 

If you are a developer at Justice Reskill and would like to be assigned as a manager of the Component Library, please reach out to your team lead or engineering manager for more info.
