We're so excited that you're here and reading through this carefully prepared document. It helps us (and you) make sure that our component library stays accurate, diverse, and bug-free!

The contribution guidelines here help to ensure respect between the developers managing this library and those contributing. In the end this allows for a smoother process as the managing developers address your issues, assess changes, and help you finalize your pull requests. 

**We thank you in advance for following these guidelines!**

# Overview :earth_africa:
<a name="overview"></a> 

### :thumbsup: Types of Contributions 

The Justice Reskill Component Library is a digital space where our community, whether student or employee, can come together and bond through code. The library is only as robust as we make it, so we depend on everyone to keep this library stocked and up-to-date. That's where you come in! There are many ways to contribute, from improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code to submit your very own component to the library.

### :pray: Please Don't 

Please don't submit a fully functional application here. Submitted components should be easy to read through and throw into an existing code base. A majority of components will only require one file to implement, so think small. A component should pass testing standards, but may not be production ready. The library is here to provide a platform for developers who want to take your code into production for their specific use case, therefore it needs to be easy to customize and understand.

We also request that you not submit support questions as an issue. For any support needs, visit the appropriate Slack channel in the Justice Reskill workspace.

# Ground Rules :guardsman:
<a name="ground-rules"></a>
### Culture 
We aim to keep a welcoming and open environment for all those who want to be part of the Justice Reskill Component Library. The following lists out just some of the ways we can do that through our interactions. This is by no means a comprehensive list, and we encourage everyone to listen and adapt. 

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of differeing viewpoints and opinions
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the Justice Reskill community
- Show empathy towards others.

### Tech Responsibilites 
- To the best of your ability ensure [cross-browser compatibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Introduction) for all components submitted. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, etc..
- Ensure that code meets all requirements on this checklist: https://gist.github.com/audreyr/4feef90445b9680475f2
- Create issues for any changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
- Don't add any collections to the library unless absolutely necessary.
- Keep pull requests as small as possible. Preferably one component per pull request.
- Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

# Your First Contribution :raising_hand:
<a name="first-contribution"></a>
The Component Library is a great place to try out your first contribution. There are loads of ways to add to the library, and the following info will help you navigate those options.

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:
### :round_pushpin: [Beginner issues]() - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
   Beginner issues can involve fixing a bug in a component, creating a small component, or adding in documentation. If you get stuck anywhere, comment on the issues and someone should hopefully be able to help out. 
   
### :handshake: [Help wanted issues]() - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues. 
   Help wanted issues can be a bit more complex than beginner issues, but they allow you to pair with the other developer who is working on this issue. Don't worry you won't be taking the lead here, but these issues can be a good transition point to work on something bigger by yourself. 

If you're still concerned about contributing, here are a couple of resources to help:
- [Making a pull request](http://makeapullrequest.com/)
- [Github Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk)

# Getting started :sunny:
<a name="getting-started"></a>

* Legal info? Maybe something about how this is a Library for Justice Reskill community ONLY. You have to be a student or an employee?

### Contribution Process
The contribution process may look different for everyone dependent on the complexity of the issue assigned. No matter what the recommended steps are:

1. [Pick/Create issue]() and assign yourself
   * If you are creating an issue, please be sure to answer the following questions. 
2. Clone the repository
   * Checkout this resource for cloning a repository to your local machine.
   
3. Create a new branch
   * Checkout this resource for creating and managing branches
   
4. Comment or push code once a month
   * If we don't hear from you or see any activity on the issue you assigned yourself after one month, we'll take you off of it to open the issue up for others.
   
5. Create a Pull Request
   * Before you create a pull request make sure you're passing the testing requirements outlined below!
   We also provide a Pull Request Template that you can find here. It should load in automatically when you create a pull request, but in case it doesn't feel free to copy and paste the one provided. Be sure to fill out everything on the pull request and make sure you can check off all the boxes!
   Checkout this resource for creating a Pull Request.
   
6. Respond to feedback
   * Once your pull request is out in the wild, one of our managing developers will respond with any feedback or changes that need to be applied in order to merge your pull request into main. 
   The feedback process may take a few rounds to get it right. Don't worry. We all go through that process, and the feedback helps us all grow as developers as well as ensure code quality in the library. 
   Checkout this resource about merging
   
7. Celebrate when merged!

### Testing Requirements 
Code must pass some sort of testing. Testing will vary from component to component... maybe using some sort of test coverage package and showing passing tests along with that coverage package.

### Dev Environment 
Make sure your dev environment matches the one of the collection you want to add to. Check that collection's markdown file for further instuctions. 

# Report a Bug :bug:
<a name="report-bug"></a>

### Security Vulnerabilities 
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email XXXX instead.

### Filing a Bug Report 

When starting a bug issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
1. What dev environment (and the versions) are you using?
2. What web browser are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?


# Suggesting an Enhancement :mega:
<a name="suggest-enhancment"></a>

### Component Library Roadmap and Goals 
This information will give contributors context before they make suggestions that may not align with the project’s needs.

### Suggesting a Collection 
If there is back-and-forth or signoff required, say so. Ask them to scope the feature, thinking through why it’s needed and how it might work.

# Code review process :mag_right:
<a name="code-review-process"></a>
### :hourglass_flowing_sand: Timeline 
There is no set timeline for how long a review process may take. Since managing developers are also working on Justice Reskill client projects, it may take some time to receive feedback on your pull request. This is why we recommend you make each pull request as small and readable as possible. Managing developers will try their hardest to respond to your pull request with feedback or a timeline update within two weeks. 

If it has been over a month and you have not heard from a managing developer on your pull request, go ahead and tag them in a comment to check-in.

### :eyes: Review Team 
Justice Reskill Developers are assigned to manage the component library as needed. The managing developers may change over time, but all work for Justice Reskill in some capacity. Access to merge or push code to the main branch is only given to managing developers, and upper level developers at Justice Reskill. 

If you are a developer at Justice Reskill and would like to be assigned as a manager of the Component Library, please reach out to your team lead or engineering manager for more info.

# Community :speech_balloon:
<a name="community"></a>
Justice Reskill Slack Workspace. Specific channel for the component library?
